h1. Gaza Map for Routing

The service is currently deployed at: "Gaza Map":http://gazamap.dyndns.org/map/


h2. Community Routing Service to provide Aid and Health Services to Gaza

Due to the sad events of January 2009 a need for street data and an ambulance routing service was identified by NGOs and aid agencies. This application was developed for this purpose.   

h2. How does Gaza Map work?

The service uses the most recent data snapshot from "OpenStreetMap":http://www.openstreetmap.org/ along with "PostGIS":http://postgis.refractions.net/, "pgRouting":http://pgrouting.postlbs.org/ and "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ to create a webservice for routing.

h2. Using RESTful webservice    

Below are some of the ways you can use this webservice:

h3. GET new routes

This is how you get a new route

h3. POST a new ambulance 

This is how you can enter data to identify you new ambulance

h3. PUT to update your ambulance location 

To update you ambulance location you can use this webservice from a GSM or internet enabled GPS
